+ If we want to give instructions to the Web Container then we should use directives.

+ Syntax:  <%@ directive attribute=value %>

+ There are three directives in JSP.

	- page directive
		* It is used to control servlet translation.
		* e.g <%@ page language="java" %>
	- include directive
		* It is used to add .html or .jsp file statitically.
		* e.g <%@ include file="..."%>
	- taglib directive
		* It is required to use third party or custom tags.
		

+ Page directive:
	- It defines page specific properties.

	- Attributes of page directive:
		* language : defines the scripting language used in scriptlets and expression

		* contentType : defines content/MIME type

		* import : defines java import statements

		* isErrorPage : to define error page

		* errorPage : defines the URL to resource to which uncaught exception should be 			      sent.

		* session : defines whether the page will have an implicit session object.

		* isThreadSafe : defines whether the translated servlet needs to implement 			 		 SingleThreadModel. Default value is true means it is already thread safe do not apply thread safty.

+ include directive:
	- <%@ include file="URI of file"%>
