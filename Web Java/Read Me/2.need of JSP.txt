What is need of Java server pages?

1. JSP allows developer to separate presentation logic from Business logic and data manipulation logic.
	In context of JSP:
	- JSP : should contain presentation logic.
	- Java Beans : should contain business logic.
	- Dao : should contain data manipulation logic.

2. It simplifies the development.
	Web Container automatically converts JSP into Servlets. It Compiles servlet and 	deploy automatically.	

3. For faster development we can use tools/IDE.
