+ Java EE:
	- Current Java EE version is 1.7
	- Java EE is a specification defined by Oracle/Sun.
	- Java EE specification :
		* Servlet
		* JSP
		* JPA
	- Implementing Java EE specification is a job of Web Server and Application Server.
	
+ Web Server:
	- It contains Web container and some extra services.
		Web Container = Servlet container + JSP Container;
	 	Extra Services = Connection Pooling + JNDI
	- It is responsible for taking care of presentation logic.
	- Apache Tomcat is Java EE complaint Web Server.


+ Application Server:
	- It contains Web Container as well as EJB container.
	- It is responsible for taking care of business logic.
	- Following are the Application Server:
		* Glassfish 				--> 	Oracle / Sun
		* Tomee 						--> 	Apache
		* JBoss (wild fly)	--> 	Red Hat 
		* weblogic	 				--> 	Oracle / BEA 
		* Websphere	 				--> 	IBM 


+ Why to use Java EE?
	- Java EE can support different types of clients. For example thin client, thick client 	  		and smart client.
	  * thin client		-->	Web browser.
		* thick client	-->	Desktop application.
		* smart client	-->	Mobile application.


	- Java EE gives us server independance.
		* We can create and deploy web application on any Java EE complaint server.
		* Guaranteed to produce same results on any other Java EE server.
	
	- Java EE has provided implementation of primary services.
		* Connection Pooling
		* Security
		* Email etc.
  	so Instead of worrying about these services developer can focus on business logic.
