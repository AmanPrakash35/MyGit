+ SessionFactory

1.Single Data Store : – It is single data store for your whole application. Although you can have multiple SessionFactory but each SessionFactory will have one different database associated with it.

2.Thread Safe : – SessionFactory is thread safe so due to this feature many thread can access the SessionFactory.

3.Immutable : - Once the SessionFactory's object is created you can not change or set the values of Session Facotyr. Its internal state is set at the time of creation.

4.Singleton : – SessionFactory is built at the time of application startup and it follows the singleton design pattern.

So in short, SessionFactory objects are one per application and Session objects are one per client.
