+ Persistence
	- It is minor pillar of oops.
	- It is the process of storing data on secondry storage.	
	- We can achieve it using:
		* File
		* Database


+ Limitations of JDBC:
	- In JDBC, you can only pass parameters to Statements using indexing, that start from 1.

	- lack of support for transforming a ResultSet into a DTO/POJO

	- too verbose for CRUD operations

	- no application-level caching integration support

	- lack of pessimistic and optimistic locking support
